# TalkToDB: Talk to a Database

This is an end-to-end LLM project built using Google PaLM and LangChain.
It enables natural language interaction with a MySQL database â€” allowing users to ask questions in plain English, which are then converted into SQL queries, executed on the database, and returned as accurate answers.

Tees is a T-shirt store that maintains its inventory, sales, and discount data in a MySQL database. A store manager can ask questions such as:

How many white Adidas T-shirts do we have left in stock?

How much sales will we generate if we sell all extra-small T-shirts after applying discounts?

The system intelligently generates accurate SQL queries for such questions and executes them on the MySQL database.

## Project Highlights

- Tees is a t shirt store that sells Adidas, Nike, Van Heusen and Levi's t shirts 
- Their inventory, sales and discounts data is stored in a MySQL database
- I have builded an LLM based question and answer system that will use following,
  - Google Palm LLM
  - Hugging face embeddings
  - Streamlit for UI
  - Langchain framework
  - Chromadb as a vector store
  - Few shot learning
- In the UI, store manager will ask questions in a natural language and it will produce the answers


## Installation

1.Clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
https://github.com/Dakshy123er/TalkToDatabase.git
```
2.Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
  cd 4_sqldb_tshirts
```
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4.Acquire an api key through makersuite.google.com and put it in .env file

```bash
  GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```
5. For database setup, run database/db_creation_atliq_t_shirts.sql in your MySQL workbench

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app by executing:
```bash
streamlit run main.py

```

2.The web app will open in your browser where you can ask questions

## Sample Questions
  - How many total t shirts are left in total in stock?
  - How many t-shirts do we have left for Nike in XS size and white color?
  - How much is the total price of the inventory for all S-size t-shirts?
  - How much sales amount will be generated if we sell all small size adidas shirts today after discounts?
  
## Project Structure

- main.py: The main Streamlit application script.
- langchain_helper.py: This has all the langchain code
- requirements.txt: A list of required Python packages for the project.
- few_shots.py: Contains few shot prompts
- .env: Configuration file for storing your Google API key.
